# Artificial Intelligence for Course Offering Planning at the Federal University of ABC
This project presents a machine learning approach to help the Federal University of ABC plan its course offerings. At the university, students face the challenge of a discrepancy between the number of places offered for a subject and actual demand, which prevents some students from taking all the subjects they need, often delaying their graduation. To this end, a system was developed using machine learning algorithms and graphics to predict student demand. To analyze enrollment history and identify patterns, previous enrollment data was collected and used to train a decision tree machine learning model. Using the model and graphs, it was possible to predict student demand every four months. Thus, with the proposed approach, it is possible to help the university better plan its course offerings. This system demonstrates the potential of machine learning to improve accessibility to degree courses and reduce student retention at the university.
